    <h1>Dark Worlds</h1>
    <p>The shadows seem like a place for the wicked and the damned, but it is a place where beauty is hidden,<br>
      if you're willing to venture in and look for it. I think the horror/dark theme in its many forms, movies,<br>
      literature, urban legends, etc, has also influenced my art deeply.</p>
